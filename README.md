# MOB_Specialization_Project
In the repository we will upload all source-code and 3D-models that we create in this project

## Purpose and Goal
Many people are lost at sea every year. When a person falls into the water, a countdown-clock begins.
The longer they are in the water, the lower their changes of survival become.

When searching for people floating in water, a helicopter or boats are normally used, but sometimes this isn't enough.
Usually a single helicopter is dispatched and only nearby boats are pulled into the search. The lack of cheaper automated drones that can
help in the localization of the person could be a potential life-saver.

In this project, we will try to design a system that can locate a person in water, and estimate their posistion from a vantage point 20-30 meters
above the waves. Using a combination of Computer Vision, robotics and embedded devices, the goal is to create a reliable, robust and standalone device
that contains all nessecary sensors, computers and batteries. This "package" could then be mounted to any drone, helicopter or plane, to aid in the discovery
and recovery of a person in distress.
